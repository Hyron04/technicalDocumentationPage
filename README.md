## Introduction

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. It is widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has grown to become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

## What is Python?

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python's syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java.

## Python Syntax

Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and its code highly readable. Python uses indentation to define code blocks, instead of curly braces or keywords. Here is an example of a simple Python function:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
